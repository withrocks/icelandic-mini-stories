Jessica recently started a new job.

She’s been enjoying the work very much, although

she’s been having some problems with her boss.

During meetings, if she tries to say something,

the boss won’t let her talk.

She wishes he would give her more of a chance to speak,

and she would like it if he cared more about her opinions.

She hopes she’ll be able to solve this problem.

She could look for a new job again, but overall

she thinks it’ll be better if she stays with this one.
