**A)**
Tony has been hiking in the mountains for three days.
He’s had to stop to look at his map.
He should have been going West,
but he doesn’t recognize anything on the map.
If he had been going West, he should have come to a lake by now.
He thinks he might have been going North instead.

He would like to use his phone map to check,

but the hiking brochure said there would be no reception in the
mountains.

Maybe if he gets some sleep, he’ll be able to figure it out tomorrow.
