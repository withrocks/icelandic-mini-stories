A\)

I’ve been trying to go to sleep for two hours.

But I haven’t been able to close my eyes.

I’ve been thinking about today.

It was my first day at the new job.

I keep wondering if I did a good job.

I’m wondering if I can get along with my co-workers.

The recruiter said I was very qualified for the job.

If that’s true, I feel like the first day should have been easier.

I am thinking maybe I should write some of these feelings down.

If I do, perhaps I’ll be able to get some sleep.
