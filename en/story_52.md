The next story is about a woman who has become a grandmother.

A\)

My granddaughter just had a baby!

She brought her baby son to our house today

so we could meet him for the first time.

I had forgotten how tiny babies could be.

He had tiny fingers and toes,

and he didn’t cry very much while he was visiting.

We took turns holding and carrying him,

and I even helped change his diaper once.

In that moment, I felt happy to be an older woman with adult children.

I don’t miss changing my daughter’s diaper at all.

Now the same story told differently.
