**A)**

James used to wake up early on Saturdays.

Usually he looked outside to check the weather.

Often he had seen that the weather was nice and sunny.

When it was, James usually decided to go to the beach.

The beach was about an hour away by car.

Each time he left, he first looked for his bathing suit.

But each time it was difficult to find his bathing suit.

Usually James finally found it in his closet.

Sometimes, by the time he was ready to leave, the weather had become
cloudy!

Then he’d hoped to go to the beach the next day.
