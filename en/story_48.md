A\)

My parents told me that I have to go to university.

They said that if I get a degree, I will be able to get a good job.

However, my friend recently told me about online courses.

She said I ought to study my favourite topics online.

If I do that, I can save a lot of money.

Now, I’m not sure what I should do.

If I go to university, I can get a degree.

On the other hand, if I study online, I can learn the same material much
more cheaply.

I might have to give both of them a try.

If I try both, I should then be able to make up my mind.
