**A)**

Adrian’s favourite singer had a concert last month.

Adrian had wanted to go to the concert.

He would have had to buy tickets so he could go.

He’d started looking for tickets online

But there had only been a few tickets left.

Many tickets had already been sold.

Adrian had almost chosen the best seat ticket left.

But the seat was a little too far from the stage.

Adrian decided it wasn’t good enough.

He decided to try again next time.

**B)**

My favourite singer will be having a concert next month.

My friend will be wanting to go to the concert.

I’ll be buying tickets tomorrow so I can go to the concert, too.

I’ll start looking for tickets online.

But I’m sure there will only be a few tickets left.

Many tickets will already be sold.

Tomorrow, I’ll be choosing the best seat ticket that’s left.

The seat will probably be a little too far from the stage

But I think it’ll be good enough.

I’ll just be happy I got a ticket.
