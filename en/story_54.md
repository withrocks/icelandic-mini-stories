This is the story of Mariah who is stranded at the park.

Mariah is stranded at the park.

She’d gone to a summer music festival there,

but it had ended later than she’d expected.

Now, the buses have stopped running,

and there are hundreds of people trying to leave at once.

Mariah has requested an Uber driver on her phone.

She’s never used Uber before, and hopes it’s safe.
