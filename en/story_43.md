**A)**

Ben is looking at his schedule for school.

He has a very busy schedule.

All of his classes are ninety minutes long.

And all of his weekdays are full.

He doesn’t have much free time in the evenings,

and he doesn’t have any free time on Mondays.

He doesn’t have any classes on weekends, though,

so he should have a little time to see his friends then.

Although he still has a little time for himself,

most of his time is going to be for studying.
