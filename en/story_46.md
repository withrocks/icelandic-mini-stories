A\)

Lin will be catching a flight to L.A. tonight.

She has an important sales presentation to give there.

She is very nervous about it, since

this will be her first time speaking in front of a large audience.

Her boss told her it was very important that she do a good job.

He said that the success of the new product depended on her.

Lin doesn’t like this kind of pressure.

She’s worried that she will get fired if she makes a mistake.

Nevertheless, she’s trying to think positively.

Maybe if she does well, she will get promoted instead.
