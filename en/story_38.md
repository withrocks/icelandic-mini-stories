Sasha and Jen had been friends during high school.

They’d usually watched movies and listened to music together.

Sasha’s favourite actor then had been tall and handsome.

He’d been in many movies, and had been very popular.

Jen’s favourite actor had also been very popular at the time.

Now Sasha tells the story.
