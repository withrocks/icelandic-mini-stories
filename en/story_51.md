A\)

Kevin has been looking for a new mp3 player.

He has looked in many stores in the area where he lives,

yet he’s been unable to find anything affordable.

So then Kevin decided to look online instead.

Even though he doesn’t really trust online shopping,

he hoped that online products would be more affordable.

After searching and scrolling for a few hours,

Kevin found an mp3 player that he liked.

It was about half the price of the others, so he bought it.

He hopes it will last a long time.
